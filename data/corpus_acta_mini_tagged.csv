The specimen directions are indicated by the coordinate system. The bending load (F) was applied with an indenter and the two supports (separation distance = 8.2 mm) were positioned on the opposite side, leading to sample bending. The measured residual plastic bending along the symmetry axis after the test was 320 µm. The boxed regions indicate regions from which the EBSD maps were acquired. (b) Load-displacement plot indicating the load levels at which the EBSD maps were acquired, and FE analysis (FEA) was performed. The Fig. is an adaption of Figs 1 and 2b in Ref. [14].",8,EBSD

The stresses induced by 3-point bending of the sample in the coarse  β  orientation map EBSD0 are obtained from FE analysis (left hand side) and the average stresses   σ ¯   in the regions EBSD1 and EBSD2 are used as homogeneous boundary conditions for the EFFT model. The EFFT model operates on orientation maps containing  α  and  β  phase, in which areas of martensitic   α  ″    were reverted to  β  (right hand side). The local stress field from the EFFT model, the   β   crystal orientations of maps EBSD1 and EBSD2, the transformation strains and crystal symmetries are used to compute the available work for the different   α  ″    variants.",8,EBSD

A symmetry region is defined along the indenter axis to reduce the overall number of elements. The image shows adaptive meshing in critical contact areas. The orientations of  β  grains are shown relative to the x-axis and represent element groups with anisotropic elastic properties and local coordinate systems. The inset demonstrates the mesh-resolution for the brick elements that were imported from EBSD data and shows three examples of local coordinate systems.
